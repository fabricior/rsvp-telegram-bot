## Tech stack

- NodeJs
- TypeScript
- telegraf
- MongoDB
- Prisma
- Jest
- Docker

### Features overview

- Create a new game by sending the `/new` command using following format: 
    
    `/new YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM MAX`

    where:
    - `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date to schedule the new game for
    - `HH:MM` is the time to schedule the new game at
    - `MAX` is the maximum number of players
    
    For example, `/new 2022-04-19 20:00 10` will schedule a new game for **4/19/2022 at 08:00 PM** with a max number of players set at **10**.

- Users can RSVP by sending `/yes` `/no` `/maybe` commands:

- At all times, you can send the `/status` command to see if there are any upcoming games. If so, the bot will display attendance details:

- To add guests, that is, users that are not part of the group chat, use `/guest_add GUEST-NAME`

- Guests are also displayed and accounted in the `/status` command

## How to deploy and use your own instance of this bot

1. Create your own Telegram bot

Please refer to Telegram documentation to [create your own telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).

2. Database Setup

    2.1 Create a MongoDb instance configured as replica set.

    2.2 Run `npx prisma db push` 

3. Build the docker image

`docker build --tag rsvp-telegram-bot:latest .`

4. Run the container

Either locally / on premise using `docker -run ` or using a Cloud provider.

In any case, make sure the runtime gets the required environment variables. See `.env.template` and the [Development section](#Development) for details.

There is a health-check endpoint available at port 8080 by default.

**Alternative**: instead of running a container, you can run a debug version of this repo locally. See the [Development section](#Development) for details.

5. Setup Bot in a Telegram group chat

    5.1 Add your bot as **Administrator** to a group chat.
    
    5.2 Send `/init <language>` command
            
    ![Screenshot of Sending /init command.](/assets/01-Init.png "Sending /init command")
    
    5.3 Users need to `/enroll` to be included in the list of players. This needs to be done just **once** per user.
    
    ![Screenshot of Sending /enroll command.](/assets/02-Enroll.png "Sending /enroll command")

6. _Optionally_, configure bot commands to enable command autocomplete and inline help.

    4.1 Open chat with @BotFather

    4.2 Send the `setcommands` command

    4.3 Select your bot

    4.4 Send below message:
```
init - Initialize the robot.
enroll - Each player needs to send this command to let the bot know they want to interact with it. This needs to be done just once per user.
new - creates a new game. Usage: /new YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM MAX
yes - you are attending the upcoming game
no - you are NOT attending the upcoming game
maybe - you don't know yet if you can make it
status - get details about the attendance of players
guest_add - Add a guest player. Usage: /guest_add <name>
guest_remove - Removes a guest player. Usage: /guest_remove <number>
```
