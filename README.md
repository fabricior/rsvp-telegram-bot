3. Users need to `/enroll` in order to be able to included the list of players. This needs to be done just **once** per user, per group.

### Using the bot 

1. To create a new game, send the `/new` command which accepts 3 arguments: 
    `/new YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM MAX`
    where:
    `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date to schedule the new game for
    `HH:MM` is the time to schedule the new game at
    `MAX` is the maximum number of players
    
For example, `/new 2022-04-19 20:00 10` will schedule a new game for 4/19/2022 at 08:00 PM with a max number of players set at 10.

2. Users can RSVP by sending `/yes` `/no` `/maybe` commands

3. At all times, you can send the `/status` command to see if there are any upcoming games.
